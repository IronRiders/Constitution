# The Iron Riders Robotics Club Constitution
Seattle, Washington

## Article 1: Name

This club will be referred to as the Iron Riders.

## Article 2: Purpose

This club's purpose is to include students interested in participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition, in the construction of complex robots, advanced mechanics, software programming,  business management, competition strategy, or any students interested in recruiting corporate sponsors or advertising/marketing. The goals of The Iron Riders are:

* To compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
* To gain members for growth and development of the Roosevelt community as well as FIRST Robotics.
* To encourage leadership, engineering, programming, and high ethical standards respected in the business, engineering, and programming worlds.
* To promote understanding and appreciation of science and technology.
* To fundraise, gather sponsors, and provide recognition for local businesses through our business team.
* To promote social development between different ages, genders, cultures, groups, communities, and people through the Robotics Club, the FIRST organization, and our group activities from meetings, events, FIRST Competitions, etc.
* To represent Roosevelt High School well and leave a respectable image as representatives of our school.
* To uphold the values of the FIRST organization.

## Article 3: Organization

A student leadership team will govern the Iron Riders Robotics Club with the advice and consent of the faculty advisors. The student leadership team is outlined in Articles 4 and 11. Each member of the leadership team must be actively participating as a FIRST member for the current FIRST season.

## Article 4: Leadership Team

The club will consist of one Team Captain, a Communications Lead, a Project Manager, Build Lead, Software Lead, CAD Lead, Business Manager, and a Strategy Lead. They communicate and organize meetings.

These leads are responsible for organizing meetings and creating agendas for each meeting. Each lead will have meeting responsibilities divvied up in the by-laws.

## Article 5: Election Process

The current leads announce the election two weeks prior to the election day. Candidates announce their candidacy no later than one week prior to the election by submitting a written statement and speech. Leads are elected by running for the position and receiving a majority of votes from members who are voting, if there is competition for the position. Any unfilled position will be filled by a volunteer. Elections will be held after the end of Competition Season but before the end of the school year. A meeting will be held for the candidates to present their platform, and voting will proceed at the next club meeting. A candidate need not be present at the meeting to run, but must have submitted a written platform when they declared their candidacy.

Each member of the leadership team will maintain their position until the next election. All leads must be actively involved in FIRST Robotics and be in good ethical standing. Each lead has the opportunity to be re-elected for the next FIRST season.

A member of the leadership team is expected to meet the responsibilities associated with their position, and, if unable, they may choose to step down after talking with a mentor. They must appoint an interim lead which must be approved by a simple majority of the other leads until the position is filled.

If the lead continues to not meet the expectations associated with their position and chooses not to step down, they may be impeached by five out of the other seven. If impeached, that person is no longer a lead, and cannot become a lead again until the next general election. It is up to the remaining leads whether or not to appoint an interim lead during the offseason, however, during competition season, they must choose an interim lead.

If a lead disappears, it is up to the mentors and other leads to decide which of the above two paths to take.

If there is a vacancy before competition season, a special election is held that follows the same rules as that year's general election, but only for the vacant position. If there is a vacancy during or after competition season, the interim lead serves until the next general election.

## Article 6: Meetings

### General Meetings

Club meetings will start after school at the discretion of the leads. All meetings will happen in room 217 unless otherwise noted.

### Leadership Meetings

Leadership meetings will be held once a week at the discretion of the leads. Any member can attend these meetings and contribute to discussions, but the leads reserve the right to kick out any member that they feel are not contributing positively to the conversation. A meeting agenda will be posted to the team announcements forum at least 24 hours in advance and a summary will be posted within one school day. Both of these jobs will be done by the Team Captain, Communications Lead, and project manager (or otherwise delegated). In the case of a lead being absent from a leadership meeting, they must appoint a representative to attend the meeting, vote in their place, and inform the lead of what happened while they were gone. This should be done 24 hours in advance. In order for a meeting to be valid, there must be at least seven leads or representatives present to establish quorum.

## Article 7: Advisor(s)

The Iron Riders Robotics Club advisors shall be Mr. K Ruff (Engineering and Technology).

## Article 8: Finances

The Iron Riders Robotics Club is responsible for its finances, organizing the cost of activities, recruiting sponsors, acquiring donations, and managing the club bank account.

## Article 9: Amendments

To make any amendments to this constitution, a written proposal must be presented to the current captain and advisor of the Roosevelt Robotics Club. Amendments can be presented by any club member. A decision will be made by the leadership as to whether to present the amendment to the entire club. A simple leadership majority ratifies the amendment.

## Article 10: Ratification

The signatures of a majority of the leadership and the club advisors shall ratify this constitution.

## Article 11: Amendments
