# The Iron Riders Robotics Club Constitution
Seattle, Washington

## Article 1: Name

This club will be referred to as the Iron Riders.

## Article 2: Purpose

This club's purpose is to include students interested in participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition, in the construction of complex robots, advanced mechanics, software programming,  business management, competition strategy, or any students interested in recruiting corporate sponsors or advertising/marketing. The goals of The Iron Riders are:

* To compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
* To gain members for growth and development of the Roosevelt community as well as FIRST Robotics.
* To encourage leadership, engineering, programming, and high ethical standards respected in the business, engineering, and programming worlds.
* To promote understanding and appreciation of science and technology.
* To fundraise, gather sponsors, and provide recognition for local businesses through our business team.
* To promote social development between different ages, genders, cultures, groups, communities, and people through the Robotics Club, the FIRST organization, and our group activities from meetings, events, FIRST Competitions, etc.
* To represent Roosevelt High School well and leave a respectable image as representatives of our school.
* To uphold the values of the FIRST organization.

## Article 3: Organization

A student leadership team will govern the Iron Riders Robotics Club with the advice and consent of the faculty advisors. The student leadership team is outlined in Articles 4 and 11. Each member of the leadership team must be actively participating as a FIRST member for the current FIRST season.

## Article 4: Leadership Team

The club will consist of one Team Captain, a VP/Communications Lead, a Project Manager, Build Specialist, Software Lead, CAD Specialist, Business Manager, and a Strategy Lead. They communicate and organize meetings.

These leads are responsible for organizing meetings and creating agendas for each meeting. Each lead will have meeting responsibilities divvied up in the by-laws.

## Article 5: Election Process

The current leads announce the election two weeks prior to the election day. Candidates announce their candidacy no later than one week prior to the election by submitting a written statement and speech. Leads are elected by running for the position and receiving a majority of votes from members who are voting, if there is competition for the position. Any uncontested position will be filled by a volunteer. Elections will be held after the end of Competition Season but before the end of the school year. A meeting will be held for the candidates to present their platform, and voting will proceed at the next club meeting. In person attendance is required to vote. A candidate need not be present at the meeting to run, but must have submitted a written platform when they declared their candidacy.

Each member of the leadership team will maintain their position until the next election. All leads must be actively involved in FIRST Robotics and be in good ethical standing. Each lead has the opportunity to be re-elected for the next FIRST season.

A member of the leadership team is expected to meet the responsibilities associated with their position, and, if unable, they may choose to step down. An emergency election is held and a new candidate is elected within two weeks of the lead stepping down. If a lead leaves leadership between general elections, they cannot become a lead again until the next general election.

If the lead continues to not meet the expectations associated with their position and chooses not to step down, a challenge to the position may occur. In a challenge, a Robotics club member runs in a challenge election against the current lead. If a simple majority (over 50%) of club leadership vote for the challenging candidate, the current lead is removed from office and the challenger takes his/her position.

## Article 6: Meetings

### General Meetings

Club meetings will start 15 minutes after school ends. Meetings will be held every day for curriculum after the club kickoff. When the competition is revealed in January, meetings will be held every day after school to build the competition robot. The leads will organize and run update meetings on Tuesdays. All meetings will happen in room 217 unless otherwise noted.

### Leadership Meetings

Leadership meetings will be held on Mondays from 3:30-4:30, unless otherwise noted. Any member can attend these meetings and contribute to discussions, but the leads reserve the right to kick out any member that they feel are not contributing positively to the conversation. A meeting agenda will be posted to the team announcements forum at least 24 hours in advance and a summary will be posted within one school day. Both of these jobs will be done by the Team Captain, VP/Communications Lead, and project manager (or otherwise delegated). In the case of a lead being absent from a leadership meeting, they must appoint a representative to attend the meeting, vote in their place, and inform the lead of what happened while they were gone. This should be done 24 hours in advance.

## Article 7: Advisor(s)

The Iron Riders Robotics Club advisors shall be Mr. K Ruff (Engineering and Technology) and Ms. A Myers (Computer Science).

## Article 8: Finances

The Iron Riders Robotics Club is responsible for its finances, organizing the cost of activities, recruiting sponsors, acquiring donations, and managing the club bank account.

## Article 9: Amendments

To make any amendments to this constitution, a written proposal must be presented to the current President and Advisor of the Roosevelt Robotics Club. Amendments can be presented by any club member. A decision will be made by the President and Leadership as to whether to present the amendment to the entire club. A simple leadership majority ratifies the amendment.
